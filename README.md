# Retail_Sales_Analysis_Project
Performed Exploratory & Statistical Data Analysis on a Retail Sales Dataset using Python and SQL.
# Retail Sales Data Analysis using Python

## Project Overview
Engineered a complete Retail Sales Analytics pipeline using Python(Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), SQL, and Power BI to process and analyze transactional sales data. Automated data cleaning and transformation with Python, performed business analysis using SQL queries, and built dynamic Power BI dashboards with advanced DAX metrics (YoY Growth, Top-N, Running Total). Delivered actionable insights by identifying high-profit regions, loss-making products, and key sales patterns, supporting strategic decision-making.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Analyze sales and profit trends
- Identify loss-making products and regions
- Understand customer and segment performance
- Generate actionable business insights

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
Superstore retail dataset containing transactional order data including sales, profit, customer, product, and region details.

## Key Analysis Performed
- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Feature Engineering (Profit Margin, Shipping Delay, Time Features)
- Sales & Profit Analysis
- Category & Sub-category Performance
- Loss & Risk Analysis
- Customer Revenue Analysis
- Time-Series Sales Trend
- Discount vs Profit Analysis

## Key Insights
- Technology category generates highest profit.
- Excessive discounting reduces profitability.
- Few customers contribute majority of revenue.
- Some regions and sub-categories consistently generate losses.
- Sales show seasonal growth pattern.

## Business Recommendations
- Optimize discount strategy to protect margins
- Focus retention on high-value customers
- Improve performance in loss-making regions
- Re-evaluate low-profit product categories

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies : pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open notebook : jupyter notebook notebooks/Retail_Sales_Analysis.ipynb

## SQL(Structure Query Language)
- Used "SuperStore_PyCleaned" DataSet to perform SQL Operations
- This DataSet is Cleaned and Exported using Python Operations
- SQL File is also Included in the Dashboard
- ALL queries are written in MySQL Workbench
